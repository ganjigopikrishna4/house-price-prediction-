# SCT_ML_01 â€” House Price Prediction ðŸ¡

This project is part of *SkillCraft Technology Tasks*.  
It implements a *Linear Regression model* to predict house prices based on:  
- Square footage  
- Number of bedrooms  
- Number of bathrooms  

## 
Dataset  
The dataset used is *House Price Dataset* (provided in the task document).  

##  Steps Involved  
1. Load and explore the dataset.  
2. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.  
3. Implement a *Linear Regression model*.  
4. Train the model using the dataset.  
5. Evaluate the model performance using metrics like *RÂ² Score* and *Mean Squared Error*.  

##  Expected Output  
- A regression model that predicts house prices.  
- Graphs showing the relationship between features (sqft, bedrooms, bathrooms) and price.  

##  Technologies Used  
- Python ðŸ  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab
